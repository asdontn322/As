Automation Script for Excel Download and Upload

This Python project automates the process of downloading an Excel file from a legacy website, uploading it to a SharePoint document library, and uploading it to a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) storage bucket. The project uses Selenium for web automation, Office365-REST-Python-Client for SharePoint integration, and the Google Cloud Storage SDK for GCP interactions.

Prerequisites





Python: Version 3.8 or later with pip.



Google Chrome: Installed and updated for Selenium automation.



SharePoint Access: Valid credentials and access to a SharePoint document library.



GCP Access: A service account with a JSON key file and access to a storage bucket.



Text Editor/IDE: VS Code, PyCharm, or similar for editing code.

Setup Instructions (Windows)

1. Install Python





Download Python 3.8+ from python.org.



During installation:





Check "Add Python to PATH."



Ensure pip is included.



Verify installation:

python --version
pip --version

2. Clone or Create Project Directory





Create a project directory, e.g., C:\AutomationProject.



Copy the provided scripts (main.py, automate.py, sharepoint.py, upload_to_sharepoint.py, upload_to_gcp.py, requirements.txt) into this directory.



Create subdirectories:

mkdir download_folder logs

3. Install Dependencies





Ensure requirements.txt contains:

selenium
python-dotenv
Office365-REST-Python-Client
google-cloud-storage
webdriver-manager



Install dependencies:

cd C:\AutomationProject
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure ChromeDriver





The webdriver-manager package (included in requirements.txt) automatically manages ChromeDriver. No manual download is required.



Ensure automate.py uses webdriver-manager (already updated in the script).

5. Configure Environment Variables





Create a .env file in C:\AutomationProject with the following:

SHAREPOINT_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/yoursite
SHAREPOINT_USERNAME=your_username@yourdomain.com
SHAREPOINT_PASSWORD=your_password
SHAREPOINT_DOC_LIB=Shared Documents
SHAREPOINT_TARGET_FOLDER=AutomationUploads
GCP_BUCKET_NAME=your-gcp-bucket-name
GCP_CREDENTIALS_PATH=C:\AutomationProject\credentials.json



SharePoint:





Replace SHAREPOINT_SITE_URL, SHAREPOINT_USERNAME, SHAREPOINT_PASSWORD, SHAREPOINT_DOC_LIB, and SHAREPOINT_TARGET_FOLDER with your SharePoint details.



Ensure your account has access to the document library and folder.



GCP:





Create a service account in Google Cloud Console with Storage Admin permissions.



Download the JSON key file (e.g., credentials.json) and place it in C:\AutomationProject.



Update GCP_CREDENTIALS_PATH to the absolute path of the JSON file (use backslashes, e.g., C:\\AutomationProject\\credentials.json).



Set GCP_BUCKET_NAME to your GCP storage bucket name.

6. Update Scripts

The scripts have been updated to handle errors identified in the log file (automation.log). Ensure the following changes are applied:

automate.py





Simplified to directly download the Excel file due to issues with the original URL and navigation.



Uses webdriver-manager for ChromeDriver.

sharepoint.py





Added validation for environment variables to prevent 'NoneType' errors.



Ensures proper authentication and file upload.

upload_to_gcp.py





Added error handling for missing credentials or files.



Validates GCP bucket access.

main.py





Updated to propagate errors and capture subprocess output for better debugging.

upload_to_sharepoint.py





Optional wrapper for sharepoint.py. Can be removed if not needed.

7. Run the Project





Open a command prompt in the project directory:

cd C:\AutomationProject



Run the main script:

python main.py



Monitor the logs/automation.log file for execution details and errors.

8. Troubleshooting





Selenium Errors:





If net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED occurs, verify the URL in automate.py or check internet connectivity.



Ensure Chrome is updated.



SharePoint Errors:





Verify credentials and permissions.



Confirm the document library and target folder exist.



GCP Errors:





Ensure the service account has Storage Object Admin permissions.



Check the bucket name and credentials.json file.



File Not Found:





Ensure download_folder contains the downloaded file.



Verify paths in .env are correct (use absolute paths with backslashes).



Check logs/automation.log for detailed error messages.

9. Optional: Virtual Environment

To isolate dependencies:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

Notes





The URL in automate.py (https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/download/TestData.xlsx) may be invalid. Replace it with the actual website URL and adjust navigation logic if needed.



The upload_to_sharepoint.py script is redundant if sharepoint.py is used directly. Consider removing it.



Regularly check automation.log for debugging.



Ensure Windows firewall or antivirus does not block ChromeDriver or network requests.
